  ## Snail Sort

  Given an array, return the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.`n x n`

  ```
  array = [[1,2,3],
           [4,5,6],
           [7,8,9]]
  snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
  ```

  For better understanding, please follow the numbers of the next array consecutively:

  ```
  array = [[1,2,3],
           [8,9,4],
           [7,6,5]]
  snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
  ```
