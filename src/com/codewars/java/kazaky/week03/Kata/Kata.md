   Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

    Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

    You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

    If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

    All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
